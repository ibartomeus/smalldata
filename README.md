# TraitBase:
*This repo manages a flexible, individual-based, open and reproducible trait database: [www.traitbase.info](www.traitbase.info) via [traitbaseR](https://github.com/metadevpro/traitbaser)*  

*Please fill bugs as issues: [https://github.com/ibartomeus/traitbase/issues](https://github.com/ibartomeus/traitbase/issues)

The first data already available is about bee traits, but is designed so it can be easily extended to other organisms. Actually there is no comprensive database of bee traits, but information is scatered in diverse publications and private databases. However, most importantly none of this data to my knowledge capture the variability in traits, but only mean values for especies. As October 2018, Traitbase contains ~10 000 indivisual level observations of bee traits - __Apoidea__ - Other taxa are not covered yet.

Data processing is completely reproducible and is managed here (https://github.com/ibartomeus/traitbase/bee_database.R). If you are curious, you can find examples on how the workflow works at https://github.com/ibartomeus/traitbase/Example_upload_data.Rmd and https://github.com/ibartomeus/traitbase/Example_querie.Rmd (both in construction). 

The platform still have some bugs (bugs.md) and a long list of things to do (ToDo.Rmd).

# what next?

If you want to contribute with data or be the curator of another taxon, contact me and we can develop the schema for e.g. aphids, birds, spiders, etc...
