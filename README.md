(Uning bees - __Apoidea__ as a demonstration taxa)

WARNING: this is in development and I may upload fake data to test things. Do not use for research yet.  

#Example:

The example data will be about bee traits, but is designed so it can be easily extended to other organisms. Actually there is no comprensive database of bee traits, but information is scatered in diverse publications and private databases. However, most importantly none of this data to my knowledge capture the variability in traits, but only mean values for especies. 

# what next?

If you want to be the curator of another taxon, contact me and we can develop the schema for e.g. aphids, birds, spiders, etc...
