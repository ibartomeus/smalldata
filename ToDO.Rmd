#To Do:

#Data
[] Clean Bee_database.R code
    [] change DOI NA[1-9] to first name - last name (or whatever we decide with Pedro).
    [] Some datasets failing
    [] Some datasets have species that can be cleaned, or traits (paratisim) that can be included.
    [] Bombus appears as soil nester, which... meh... check Mafalda and Fortel datasets.
    [] Check lon and not long for longitude! I think long is supported.
[] Add Asensio and De Palma data. We use issues for new datasets: https://github.com/ibartomeus/traitbase/issues/7
[] Update Example_upload_data (unify with /tests) and Example_query_data.Rmd.

#Package:
    [] load taxize with package
    [] `parseErrors` paradoxialy gives an error when there are no errors (Nacho will fix this)
    [] Add to `privateImport` an if statement to show a 404 error or the 505 when this occurs.
    [] cleanSpecies gives error -> Nacho (Update from elsewhere with verbose = TRUE)
    [] Modify ParseError to target unrecognized or ambigous species for you (Nacho)
    [] To enter data make snipets that help splitting dates, genus, species, white space, etc...
    [] Implement functions: credit() to give credit already formated for a bunch of id's and
search() as a wrapper for resorce() and query().
    [] Add code of conduct, vignettes, 
    [] query function filtering for created at: to be able to reproduce the database at point X in time.
    [] Create sumary functions for phenology, distribution, lecticity...
    [] Submit to CRAN?

#Web:
index:
    [] add Beta version? near v1.0.2
Menu: 
    [] Add box search
Exploring (summary):
    [] Remove"EXPLORING" <- Species.
    [] Remove search box.
    [] Sample size and St error in one line?
    [] Bitton to download metadata?
About:
    [] Check spelling
    [X] remove "by making all data CC-by." to avoid ambiguities with sup mat data.
    [] Link to "R package"
    [X] remove "2017" JAJA
Access to data:
    [] Spelling
    [] (This can be done in 3-4 tables downloaded as a ZIP file)-> First release comming soon.
    [] "The package includes a series of useful ..." Change for link to the package.
    
    [] Add a note that if you want to remove your data, just ask.
 
    
#Media:
    [] When Beta version is ot make some noise and ask people to submit datasets.
    
#Paper:
    [] Write paper with no rush. Objectibe preprint-PCI- and think about being inclusive with authors.
