#To Do:

#Data
[] Clean Bee_database.R code
    [] change DOI NA[1-9] to first name - last name (or whatever we decide with Pedro). It will be NA's when implemented. See if we can retrieve ORCIDS from names easely in R?
    [] Some datasets failing. Test why.
    [] Some datasets have species that can be cleaned, or traits (e.g. paratisim) that can be included.
    [] Bombus appears as soil nester, which... meh... check Mafalda and Fortel datasets.
    [] Check lon and not long for longitude! I think long is supported.
[] Add Asensio and De Palma data. We use issues for new datasets: https://github.com/ibartomeus/traitbase/issues/7
[] Update Example_upload_data (unify with /tests) and Example_query_data.Rmd.

#Package:
    [] load taxize with package
    [] `parseErrors` paradoxialy gives an error when there are no errors (Nacho will fix this)
    [] Add to `privateImport` an if statement to show a 404 error or the 505 when this occurs.
    [] cleanSpecies gives error -> Nacho (Update from elsewhere with verbose = TRUE)
    [] Modify ParseError to target unrecognized or ambigous species for you (Nacho)
    [] To enter data make snipets that help splitting dates, genus, species, white space, etc... including list of accepted traits (e.g. retrieve metadata) and variables.
    [] Implement functions: credit() to give credit already formated for a bunch of id's and
search() as a wrapper for resorce() and query().
    [X] Add code of conduct, 
    [ ] vignettes, 
    [] query function filtering for created at: to be able to reproduce the database at point X in time.
    [] Create sumary functions for phenology, distribution, lecticity...
    [] Submit to CRAN?

#Web:
index:
    [] add Beta version? near v1.0.2
Menu: 
    [] Add box search
Exploring (summary):
    [] Remove"EXPLORING" <- Species.
    [] Remove search box.
    [] Sample size and St error in one line?
    [] Button to download metadata?
    [] make posible to call https://traitbase.info/species?q=Bombus%20terrestris, instead of e.g. https://traitbase.info/species?q=5b04145b2265c5000fab2abf. 
About:
    [] Check spelling
    [X] remove "by making all data CC-by." to avoid ambiguities with sup mat data.
    [] Link to "R package"
    [X] remove "2017" JAJA
Access to data:
    [] Spelling
    [] (This can be done in 3-4 tables downloaded as a ZIP file)-> First release comming soon.
    [] "The package includes a series of useful ..." Change for link to the package.
    (somewhere)
    [] Add a note that if you want to remove your data, just ask.
Contribute:
    [] All data uploaded to TRAITBASE is released using the license CC-by (please ensure you have the rights to do so). CHANGE
    [] If you want to contribute the easiest way is to download the template [link]. Make template! and upload somewhere. Traitbase repo?
    [] Pollinators = Apoidea.
Team:
    [] Ignaci!
    [] Add Curro, Jamie, and all the team...  (photos? remove photos?), etc...
Sponsors:
    [] Use only logos. 
    [] Remove teaming. Keep paypal.
    
#Media:
    [] When Beta version is on make some noise and ask people to submit datasets.
    
#Paper:
    [] Write paper with no rush. Objective preprint-PCI- and think about being inclusive with authors.
