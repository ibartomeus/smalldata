#Input data needs to be in a data.frame with the following columns:

#colnames:
#"name": UNIQUE. Name of the datset (should be unique and will be lastname_year 
    #followed by a,b,c if different datasets has the same name_year combination)
#"Desciption": UNIQUE. brief description of the dataset.
#"Credit": UNIQUE. Optional, in case we want to add some free text about how to credit the dataset
#"doi": UNIQUE. If published doi of the dataset/paper

#"local_id": Any id set in the original paper
#"species": Genua species (needs to be a valid taxon name
#"collector": If known who the collector was
#"taxonomist": If known who the taxonomist was
#"day","month","year": In separate columns
#"lat","long","location": Lat long and descriptive location if available.
#"country": If known where was collected.

#Traits: measures start by "m_"
    #"m_IT" 
    #"m_sex" (male, female, queen, ...)
    #"m_plant_genus"
    #"m_plant_species"
    #...
        #standard error start by "se_"
    #"se_IT"
    #"se_sex"
    #"se_plant_genus"
    #"se_plant_species"
    #...
        #sample size start by "n_"
    #"n_IT"
    #"n_sex"
    #"n_plant_genus"
    #"n_plant_species"
    #...

#"Contributor_name": Who to give credit name. Usa as many rows as contributors. Rest can be NA.
#"Contributor_lastname": Who to give credit last name. Usa as many rows as contributors. Rest can be NA.
#"Contributor_country": OPTIONAL. Who to give credit last name. Usa as many rows as contributors. Rest can be NA.
#"Contributor_organization": OPTIONAL. Who to give credit last name. Usa as many rows as contributors. Rest can be NA.

#Add data---
#template:
#1) Read data (read.table, read.csv...)
#2) Check observations colnames ("local_id", "species","collector","taxonomist",
    #"day","month","year","lat","long","location","country")
    #Add lat long from google maps or paper if possible.
#Check traits colnames(m_trait, se_trait, n_trait)
#3) Add known missing columns (name, description, credit, doi)
#Add contributor information (if doi, can be ignored)
    #Do not look for contributor info in detail.
#4) Remove unused columns
#5) Write dataset?
