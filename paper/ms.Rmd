#Abstract

Importance of traits, individual level.  
Lack of open, flexible curated database.
Traitbase: Infrastructure. 
Details: API, Rpackage, public release of data.
We provide an example (bees, but would be reat to have also dung beetles).


#Introduction

Traits are ...

#Main characteritics

- Individual level
- Flexible
- Validated: Automate a local check on the data: Only fully identified species will be allowed.
- Open
- Curated
- Reproducible
- Long term preserved: Ensure long term permanent repository of the data in different realeases & Doi's. 
- API

# Ethics:  
The Data Set has been released in the spirit of open scientific collaboration. Data Users are thus strongly encouraged to consider consultation, collaboration and/or co-authorship with the Data Set Creator.

#Technical specifications

Pedro, can you write down the technicalities. Database type, database structure, hosted at, unit tests implemented, 

The database structure has 5 datasets for each taxa group.

- Schema: This can be created for any group, and defines the traits and units that can be used. For now, there is only one schema, the one for bees (and maybe other pollintors). It's done in a way adding traits is easy and don't break the schema.  
- Species: Species taxonomy. This is autogenerated via `itis` and should not be edited by hand.  
- Traits: Specimen level data. Morphological, ecological, life history or physiological data measured on individuals from which to calculate mean and variance (if desired).   
- Observations: Some traits are inferred from observational data (e.g. flower specialization, range).   
- Datasets: Information stored for a set of observations like lat, long, ...  
- Contributors: Stores data to give apropiate credit.


# Examples:

Including a bit of R code, and maybe a screenshot of the webpage.
a) sex ratios / body size relationship
